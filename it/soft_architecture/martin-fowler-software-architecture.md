Architecture is

- Expert developers' shared understandng of the ysstem design.

- the decisions that you wish you could get right early.

- the decisions that are hard to change.

shared understaninf and hard to change

craftsman vs economics reasons about quality

only part of software is visible to user

architecture concerns exactly the Internal quality
